This project demonstrates how to control a DC motor using two relays (SRD-05) to achieve clockwise 
and counterclockwise rotation. The system is built using an Arduino board and basic electronic components.

###  *Components*
-DC motor (5V)
-Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
-Two-channel relay module ( SRD-05)

### *Usage*

-Apply power to the system.
-Trigger the relays to control the direction of the DC motor:
Relay 1: Clockwise rotation
Relay 2: Counterclockwise rotation
